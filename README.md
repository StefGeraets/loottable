# LootTable Generator

Inspired by the revamped [Treasure/Loot table](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1gQYS8GyaE) from [Jacob Budz](https://twitter.com/XPtoLevel3 "Jacob's Twitter") I build this simple generator.

It can be used on [github pages](https://stefgeraets.github.io/loottable/)

It is used during or before a game of Dungeons and Dragons 5e to generate individual monster loot or hoard treasure based on [this table](https://github.com/StefGeraets/loottable/blob/master/files/Random%20Treasure%20Tables%20-%20XP%20to%20Level%203.pdf).
